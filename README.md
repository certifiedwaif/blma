# Bayesian Linear Model Averaging
 [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/certifiedwaif/blma.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/certifiedwaif/blma) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/certifiedwaif/blma?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/certifiedwaif/blma)

## Linux and Mac installation instructions
If you have `gsl` installed, you should install and build the package.
 ```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_devtools("certifiedwaif/blma")
```
 The package relies on the `gsl` library
being installed. On Windows, `gsl` will be downloaded as part of the package
installation. On Mac OS X, if you are using Homebrew, gsl can be installed by
executing the command
 ```shell
brew install gsl
```
If you are using Linux, you should consult your distribution's documentation on
how to install gsl.

## How to stop getting spurious warnings when compiling RcppEigen code

Due to the version of `RcppEigen` that is on CRAN, compiling any code which
uses `Eigen` generates sometimes hundreds of lines of compiler warnings. 
This often obscures real warnings and errors that we would like to be able to
easily find! To avoid this, and have your package build less noisily, add
```
CPPFLAGS= -Wno-ignored-attributes
```

to your `~/.R/Makevars` file.

## Windows installation instructions
 Install the blma package via the R commands:
 ```r
library(devtools)
install_github("certifiedwaif/blma")
```
 Special thanks to Jerone Ooms [@opencpu](http://twitter.com/opencpu) for his
help with getting the package building on Windows automatically, and to MaÃ«lle
Salmon [@ma_salmon](http://twitter.com/ma_salmon) for CCing him in the first
place and introducing me to Travis-CI and RAppVeyor.
